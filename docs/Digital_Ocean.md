## Steps for deploying the project in Digital Ocean Platform
   
   ## Prerequisites
   - An email address to register for a free GitHub account.

     be charged for your first three sites

1. Create a GitHub Account
2. Download and Install the GitHub Desktop App
3. Create a GitHub Repository for your Website Project
4. Copy Website Files to GitHub Repository
   -  Open your website project’s working folder, or the folder that is currently storing all of your
      website project’s files and folders
   - Find and open the newly created repository folder that you named    
   - Copy the files from your working folder to your repository folder
   - Paste copies of your files into the repository folder
   - After pasting the files into your repository folder, the GitHub Desktop app should display the
     files in the “Changes” panel on the left side of the app window
   - Once your folders are in your local repository folder, you are ready to save your changes to the
     repository  
   - Click the blue button <Commit to master> located below the text fields 
   - Once you have committed your changes to the main branch, your files in the left hand panel will
     disappear as this panel only displays files that contain uncommitted changes 

5. Pushing Committed Files to GitHub
   - Add your website files to your GitHub repository
   - To publish your local repository to your GitHub repository, click on the blue ```Publish repository``` button
